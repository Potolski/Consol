- [x] `B-013` `Reputation` account struct (PDA: wallet, global)
- **Completed**: Apr 7

### 1.3 Core Instructions ✅
- [x] `B-020` `create_group` — creator initializes group with parameters

- [x] `B-023` `activate_group` — transition Forming → Active when all slots filled
- **Completed**: Apr 7

- [x] `B-030` `make_payment` — member submits monthly contribution (7d window + 3d grace + 5% late fee)
- [x] `B-031` `start_round` — initialize Round account, open collection window
- [x] `B-032` `close_collection` — lock collection, transition to Selecting
- [x] `B-033` `mark_default` — progressive collateral slashing (10% → 25% → 100%)
- [x] `B-034` `distribute` — transfer pool funds to winner (push model, 1.5% protocol fee)
- **Completed**: Apr 8

### 1.5 VRF Integration (Lottery Selection) ✅
- [x] `B-040` Research Switchboard VRF — chose commit-reveal pattern
- [x] `B-041` `commit_round` — commit phase, stores randomness account + seed slot
- [x] `B-042` `resolve_round` — reveal phase, reads VRF value, selects winner from eligible members
- [x] `B-043` End-to-end devnet test — steps 1-6 pass (create→join→activate→pay); VRF steps time-gated by 10-day close_collection window, validated by 26 unit tests
- **Completed**: Apr 13 — program redeployed with security fixes, E2E script at `scripts/e2e-vrf-test.ts`

### 1.6 Group Completion ✅
- [x] `B-050` `close_group` — finalize group (normal completion or dissolution)

- [x] `B-063` `skip_round` — handle all-default rounds (no payments / no eligible members)
- [x] `B-064` `close_group` extended — dissolution when active < MIN_GROUP_SIZE, formation timeout cancel

### 1.8 Security Audit & Hardening ✅

- [x] `B-071` Fix funds-locking bugs (distribute round-state, protocol fee treasury vault)
- [x] `B-072` Fix exploit vectors (insurance vault drain, double-default slashing, activate_group front-run)
- [x] `B-073` Fix arithmetic safety (checked u128→u64 casts, u8::MAX sentinel for received_round)
- [x] `B-074` Fix input validation (mint decimals, description length, caller-controlled eligible list)
- [x] `B-075` Relax VRF timing for cross-slot reveal consumption
- [x] `B-076` Second-pass review — compilation fixes + test helper updates
- **Completed**: Apr 10 — 16/16 code findings fixed, all 26 tests still passing
